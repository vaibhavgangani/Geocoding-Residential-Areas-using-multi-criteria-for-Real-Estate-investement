# Geocoding-Residential-Areas-using-multi-criteria-for-Real-Estate-investement
In this small project, I have done a multi-criteria analysis for residential areas suitable for real estate investment using a CSV file. Finally, after filtering out a huge dataset based on various parameters, I contacted the Address in one column and then geocoded them and at last, plotted them on an OpenStreetMap.

Source for this Dataset is HM Land Registery, Government of UK
