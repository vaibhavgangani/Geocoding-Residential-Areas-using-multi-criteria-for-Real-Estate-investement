# Geocoding-Residential-Areas-using-multi-criteria-for-Real-Estate-investement
 have made a small project for my submission in which I have done a multi-criteria analysis for residential areas suitable for real estate investment using a CSV file. Finally, after filtering out a huge dataset based on various parameters, I contacted the Address in one column and then geocoded them and at last, plotted them on an OpenStreetMap.
